NAME
    Btrees - executable comments

SYNOPSIS
    # yes, do USE the package ...
    use Btrees;

    # no constructors

    # traverse a tree and invoke a function
    traverse( $tree, $func );

    # find a node in a balanced tree
    $node = bal_tree_find( $tree, $val $cmp );

    # add a node in a balanced tree, rebalancing if required
    ($tree, $node) = bal_tree_add( $tree, $val, $cmp )

    # delete a node in a balanced tree, rebalancing if required
    ($tree, $node) = bal_tree_del( $tree, $val , $cmp )

DESCRIPTION

    Btrees uses the AVL balancing method, by G. M. Adelson-Velskii
    and E.M. Landis. Bit scavenging, as done in low level languages like
    C, is not used for height balancing since this is too expensive for
    an interpreter. Instead the actual height of each subtree is stored
    at each node. A null pointer has a height of zero. A leaf a height of
    1. A nonleaf a height of 1 greater than the height of its two children.

BUGS, CAVETS and other MUSINGS
    Characterized a speed up of 25/5 = 500%, 25 seconds using a doubly
    linked list class for search and add, versus a 5 second search, add
    and balancing using the Btrees class.
